# of Orders	    Single- thread (msec)	Multi-thread (msec)
2	             41	                    43
50	             216	                202
100          	282	                    239

According to my results, I found out that when the number of orders gets higher,
the multi threading time gets lower than the single threading time. When I only 
used two orders, the single thread time was faster than multi, but as I 
increased the number of orders, multi thread was faster. This makes sense 
because multi threads can the order processing for different customers
happen at the same time. Threads also require fewer resources and generate less
overall.
